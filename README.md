# Second central list effect

In the past there was the [Second system effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect):

> The second-system effect is the tendency of small, elegant, and successful systems to be succeeded by over-engineered,
> bloated systems, due to inflated expectations and overconfidence

In the past a lot of second systems failed because of over-engineering.

The time has changed. Less systems get developed from scratch these days.

Today the second central list effect gives you a new working system and this feels like a great relief.
Everything is shiny, new, crips. No bloat, no outdated content.
