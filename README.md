# Second central list effect

In the past there was the [Second system effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect):

> The second-system effect is the tendency of small, elegant, and successful systems to be succeeded by over-engineered,
> bloated systems, due to inflated expectations and overconfidence

In the past a lot of second systems failed because of over-engineering.

But the time has changed. Less systems get developed from scratch these days. There is now a different effect.

What does "second central list" mean? If you have a close look at these three terms, then you see something is strange. "Central list" suggest that there is exactly **one** central list. But "second"?

In this context I speak about systems in a intranet of a company. You have several central lists: customers, contracts, assets. These lists are crucial and usualy don't get duplicated without a migration plan for the old data. These central systems are or are like [ERP systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning). They get replaced less often.

But central lists of non-ERP type like issues, tickets, customer request, terms (wikis), process documentation ... these central lists are less crucial and tend to get replaced without preliminary consideration.

Let's provide some example of non-ERP "central lists": Sharepoint, Jira, Confluence, Zendesk, Redmine, YouTrack, Gitlab, DokuWiki, Xwiki, ...

If one of above tools gets used for some years, then no employee realy loves these systems because they tend to be full of outdated information.

If a new system gets introduced, the **second central list effect** gives you a new working tool and this feels like a great relief. Everything is shiny, new, crips. No bloat, no outdated content.

Everybody is excited and everybody loves the new baby.

But why do people love the new baby?

Because of the great features?

I disagree. 

The new system feels faster because it contains less information. It feels lightweight and easy to use
since only new and valid information is visible.

Don't get fooled by your feelings.

You just start again from scratch.

Imagine that you up to now use a tool called "Boring247".

This system gets used since 8 years and most data is outdated.

Now a talented salesman presents you "Shiny365". You are excited it is soooo great, this new tool.


Don't get fooled by your feelings.

You could just start from scratch with Boring247.

What feels great is "starting from scratch".

The system which you use for your central list does not matter much.

If you choose the shiny new tool: Now you loose one very important aspect.

Now there are two central lists. This is a contraction.

Now information is scattered and things get worse, although it feels good today.

Of course above text simplifies a lot of things and usualy there are good reasons for new systems.
They have new features and a simpler user experience.

I know this sounds disrespectful, neverthless I will use this word: Childish. I have seen
this childish joy about a new systems several times. And then some years later
the once shiny new thing is a bloated beast which contains a lot of (today) unrelevant information.

That's live.

# Alternatives?

Which alternatives exist?

1) you can start from scratch with your old system. Just delete everything which was not touched since X months. Choose the variable X.

2) Build a clean-up task-force. A small team should care for outdated information.

3) Before choosing a new system, set up a prototype of the new system and load all the old data into the new system. Then compare the features: Is the new system still fast and easy to use?
